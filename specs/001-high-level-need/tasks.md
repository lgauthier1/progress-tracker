## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - MVP, should complete first
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational + US1 (needs goals data) - Enhances US1 with visualizations
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational only - Independent from US1/US2, can be done in parallel with US2
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational + US1 + US3 (adds organization to goals and habits)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- After Foundational: US1 can start
- After US1: US2 and US3 can run in parallel
- After US1 + US3: US4 can start

### Within Each User Story

1. Shared types first (can be parallel with contract tests)
2. Contract tests written and FAIL before implementation
3. Backend validation/services/routes (services depend on validation)
4. Frontend API client and composables
5. Frontend UI components (can be parallel)
6. Frontend views integrating components
7. Story complete - test independently

**User Story 1**:
- All contract tests T048-T059 can run in parallel
- Validators T060-T061 can run in parallel
- Services T062-T064 sequential (dependencies)
- Routes T065-T066 can run after services
- Frontend components T071-T074 can run in parallel
- shadcn-vue installs T080-T085 can run in parallel

**User Story 2**:
- Chart abstraction T086-T090 can run in parallel
- Frontend charts T095-T096 can run in parallel

**User Story 3**:
- All contract tests T101-T109 can run in parallel
- Streak utils T111-T112 can run in parallel
- Frontend components T116-T119 can run in parallel

**User Story 4**:
- All contract tests T130-T134 can run in parallel

**Polish Phase**:
- Most polish tasks T147-T177 can run in parallel (different concerns)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (MVP)

### Step 1: Launch all contract tests together (these should FAIL initially)
```
Parallel batch:
  T048: POST /api/auth/register contract test
  T049: POST /api/auth/login contract test
  T050: GET /api/auth/me contract test
  T051: POST /api/goals contract test
  T052: GET /api/goals contract test
  T053: GET /api/goals/:id contract test
  T054: PATCH /api/goals/:id contract test
  T055: DELETE /api/goals/:id contract test
  T056: POST /api/goals/:id/progress contract test
  T057: GET /api/goals/:id/progress contract test
  T058: PATCH /api/goals/:id/progress/:entryId contract test
  T059: DELETE /api/goals/:id/progress/:entryId contract test
```

### Step 2: Create validators in parallel
```
Parallel batch:
  T060: Auth validators
  T061: Goal validators
```

### Step 3: Implement services (sequential due to dependencies)
```
Sequential:
  T062: AuthService ‚Üí T063: GoalsService ‚Üí T064: ProgressEntriesService
```

### Step 4: Create all frontend components in parallel
```
Parallel batch:
  T071: GoalCard
  T072: GoalForm
  T073: ProgressOverview
  T074: ProgressHistory
  T080-T085: All shadcn-vue components
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1: Setup (12 tasks)
2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (34 tasks) ‚Üê CRITICAL
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (39 tasks) ‚Üê MVP
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently per acceptance scenarios
5. Deploy/demo MVP

**MVP Delivers**: User registration, authentication, goal creation (both types), progress logging, history view

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. **Sprint 1**: Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (46 tasks)
2. **Sprint 2**: User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy MVP (39 tasks)
3. **Sprint 3**: User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy with charts (14 tasks)
4. **Sprint 4**: User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy with habits (29 tasks)
5. **Sprint 5**: User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy with categories (18 tasks)
6. **Sprint 6**: Polish ‚Üí Final production release (31 tasks)

**Total: 177 tasks**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundational phase:

1. **All together**: Complete Setup + Foundational (46 tasks)
2. **Developer A**: User Story 1 only (39 tasks) ‚Üí MVP ready
3. **After MVP validated**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 2 (14 tasks)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 3 (29 tasks) ‚Üê Parallel with US2
   - **Developer C**: Start Polish tasks that don't depend on US2/US3
4. **Developer C**: User Story 4 after US1 + US3 complete (18 tasks)
5. **All together**: Complete remaining Polish tasks (31 tasks)

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies, safe to parallelize
- **[Story]** label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **Contract tests are MANDATORY** per constitution (not optional)
- Verify all contract tests fail before implementing features (TDD approach)
- Chart.js MUST remain isolated behind abstraction layer (constitution requirement)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- User Story 1 is the MVP - can ship with just that story complete
- User Stories 2-4 add incremental value without breaking previous stories
- TypeScript strict mode enforced - no `any` types allowed
- All API endpoints must follow standardized error format
- All forms must use Zod validation for type safety

---

## Success Metrics

- **MVP (US1)**: 85 tasks total (Setup + Foundational + US1)
- **Full V1**: 177 tasks total (all user stories + polish)
- **Contract tests**: 37 tests covering all 28 API endpoints
- **Independent stories**: Each story (US1-US4) can be tested and validated independently
- **Parallel opportunities**: ~60% of tasks within each phase can run in parallel
- **Constitution compliance**: 100% (strict TypeScript, API tests, Chart.js isolation, mobile-ready architecture)
