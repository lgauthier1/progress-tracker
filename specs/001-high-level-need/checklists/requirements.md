# Specification Quality Checklist: Personal Progress Tracker

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain ✅ **All clarifications resolved**
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] Ready for `/speckit.plan` ✅ **Specification complete**

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Items Passed (15/15)

**Content Quality**: All checks passed ✓
- Specification is purely functional, no technical implementation details
- Focus is on user needs: tracking goals, visualizing progress, maintaining habits
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirements Quality**: Strong foundation ✓
- 36 functional requirements are specific and testable (FR-001 through FR-036, with sub-requirements for goal types and habit flexibility)
- 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P4) with clear acceptance scenarios (P5 reminders moved to out of scope)
- Edge cases identified for boundary conditions, error handling, continuous counters, and habit patterns
- Clear scope boundaries with "Out of Scope" section including reminders
- Assumptions documented for areas with reasonable defaults
- All decisions documented in Decision Log

**Clarifications Resolved**: ✓
1. **Reminders (Q1)**: Moved to out of scope for V1 - V2+ feature
2. **Progress entry mode (Q2)**: Incremental only - users log amounts added, system calculates total
3. **Habit frequency patterns (Q3)**: Full flexibility supported (daily, weekly, custom intervals, monthly, complex patterns)

**Next Step**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create technical implementation plan.

## Notes

- Specification follows "Simplicity First" constitution principle by limiting clarifications to 3 most critical decisions
- Informed defaults were chosen for non-critical aspects (documented in Assumptions section)
- User stories are independently testable with clear P1-P5 prioritization
- MVP (P1) can deliver standalone value: create goals and log progress manually
- Constitution compliance: TypeScript + PostgreSQL stack will be confirmed during `/speckit.plan` phase
- No implementation-specific details leak into spec (maintains technology-agnostic approach)

**Recent Updates**:
- 2025-10-25: Added support for continuous counter goals (e.g., "days without alcohol") in addition to target-based goals with deadlines
  - Updated FR-001 through FR-008, FR-009a, FR-010a, FR-012a, FR-016a with continuous counter requirements
  - Added acceptance scenarios 3-5 in User Story 1 demonstrating continuous counter usage
  - Updated Goal entity definition to include goal type field
  - Added edge cases for continuous counters (multiple entries per day, backdating resets, conversion between goal types)
  - Added assumptions clarifying continuous counter behavior

- 2025-10-25: User decisions finalized - all clarifications resolved
  - **Q1 (Reminders)**: Moved to out of scope for V1. User Story 5 removed. FR-029 through FR-032 removed. Reminder entity removed.
  - **Q2 (Progress logging)**: Incremental mode selected. FR-014 updated to specify incremental-only approach.
  - **Q3 (Habit frequencies)**: Full flexibility selected. FR-019 expanded to support daily, weekly, custom intervals, monthly, and complex patterns. FR-019a added for multiple completions per day. Habit entity updated with flexible frequency configuration.
  
**Constitution Compliance Alert**: 
- Q3 decision (full flexibility for habits) increases implementation complexity significantly
- This choice may challenge the "Simplicity First" principle (Constitution Principle I)
- Recommendation for `/speckit.plan` phase: Implement using phased approach within V1:
  - Phase 1: Daily and simple weekly patterns (covers 80% of use cases)
  - Phase 2: Custom intervals and monthly
  - Phase 3: Complex patterns (weekdays only, etc.)
- This maintains delivery of value while managing complexity incrementally

**Status**: ✅ Specification complete and validated. Ready for `/speckit.plan`.
