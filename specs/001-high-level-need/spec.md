# Feature Specification: Personal Progress Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `001-high-level-need`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "High-Level Need â€” Personal Progress Tracker - Create a generic application that allows a user to define and monitor measurable goals and recurring habits over time. The system should abstract different goal types (distance run, money saved, days without alcohol, etc.) under a unified model of quantitative progress toward a target within a time frame."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Track Quantifiable Goals (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

A user wants to set a specific, measurable goal and manually log their progress. This includes two types of goals:
1. **Target-based goals** with a deadline (e.g., "Save $5,000 by December 31st") - the system shows progress percentage and remaining amount/time
2. **Continuous counter goals** without a deadline (e.g., "Days without alcohol") - the system tracks accumulated count and allows resets

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - without the ability to define goals and track progress, nothing else matters. This story delivers immediate value and can stand alone as a minimal product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by (1) creating a target-based goal with target value, unit, and deadline, logging progress and viewing percentage completion; and (2) creating a continuous counter goal, logging daily progress and viewing accumulated count, then logging a reset event.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a logged-in user, **When** I create a new goal with title "Save for vacation", target value 5000, unit "dollars", and deadline "2025-12-31", **Then** the goal is saved and appears in my goals list with 0% progress
2. **Given** I have a goal "Save for vacation" with target 5000 dollars, **When** I log a progress entry of 500 dollars, **Then** my progress shows 10% complete (500/5000) and 4500 dollars remaining
3. **Given** I am a logged-in user, **When** I create a continuous counter goal with title "Days without alcohol" and unit "days", **Then** the goal is saved with a count of 0 and no deadline shown
4. **Given** I have a continuous counter goal "Days without alcohol", **When** I log progress for each consecutive day for 5 days, **Then** my count shows "5 days" accumulated
5. **Given** I have a continuous counter at 5 days, **When** I log a "reset" event (relapse), **Then** my count resets to 0 and I can start counting again
6. **Given** I have logged multiple progress entries, **When** I view my goal details, **Then** I see a chronological history of all my progress entries with dates and amounts
7. **Given** I have a target-based goal with deadline approaching, **When** I view the goal, **Then** I see the number of days remaining until the deadline
8. **Given** I have reached or exceeded my target-based goal, **When** I view the goal, **Then** the goal is marked as "Completed" with celebration indicator

### User Story 2 - Visualize Progress with Charts (Priority: P2)

A user wants to see their progress visualized over time with charts that show their trajectory toward their goal, helping them understand if they're on track or falling behind.

**Why this priority**: Visual representation significantly improves motivation and engagement. However, the tracker is functional without charts - users can still create goals and log progress. Charts enhance the experience but aren't required for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a goal, logging progress entries over multiple dates, and viewing a chart that displays progress over time with a trend line showing whether the user is on pace to meet their deadline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a goal with multiple progress entries over time, **When** I view the goal details, **Then** I see a line chart showing cumulative progress over time
2. **Given** I have a goal with a deadline, **When** I view the progress chart, **Then** I see a projection line indicating if I'm on track to meet my target by the deadline
3. **Given** I view my progress chart, **When** the chart loads, **Then** the chart displays dates on X-axis and progress values on Y-axis with clear labels
4. **Given** I have multiple goals, **When** I view my dashboard, **Then** I see a summary visualization showing progress across all active goals

---

### User Story 3 - Track Recurring Habits and Streaks (Priority: P3)

A user wants to track daily or recurring habits (e.g., "Exercise 5 times per week") and see their current streak to stay motivated through consistency tracking.

**Why this priority**: Habits are different from one-time goals - they focus on repetition and streaks. This expands the app's usefulness but represents a different tracking paradigm. Users can get significant value from goal tracking (P1-P2) without habit tracking.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a habit with a target frequency (e.g., "Exercise 3 times per week"), logging completions on multiple days, and viewing current streak count and weekly completion status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a logged-in user, **When** I create a new habit with title "Morning meditation", frequency "daily", **Then** the habit is saved with a streak count of 0
2. **Given** I have a daily habit, **When** I log a completion for today, **Then** my streak increases by 1 and today is marked as complete
3. **Given** I have a 5-day streak, **When** I miss a day (don't log completion), **Then** my streak resets to 0 on the following day
4. **Given** I have a weekly habit "Exercise 3 times per week", **When** I view the habit, **Then** I see my progress for the current week (e.g., "2/3 completed")
5. **Given** I have completed a habit, **When** I view the habit details, **Then** I see a calendar view showing which days I completed the habit over the past month

---

### User Story 4 - Organize Goals by Categories (Priority: P4)

A user wants to organize their goals and habits into categories (Health, Finance, Lifestyle, etc.) so they can focus on specific life areas and view progress within each category.

**Why this priority**: Categories improve organization for users with many goals but aren't essential for core functionality. Users can effectively track progress without categorization. This is a quality-of-life improvement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple categories, assigning goals to categories, and filtering the goals list to show only goals in a specific category.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a logged-in user, **When** I create a new category "Health", **Then** the category is available for assigning to goals
2. **Given** I have created categories, **When** I create or edit a goal, **Then** I can select a category from a dropdown
3. **Given** I have goals in different categories, **When** I view my dashboard, **Then** I can filter goals by category
4. **Given** I am viewing a category, **When** I check the category statistics, **Then** I see aggregate progress for all goals in that category

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to log negative progress or progress that exceeds the goal target by a large margin?
- How does the system handle goals with deadlines in the past that aren't completed?
- What happens when a user changes the target value or deadline of an existing goal with logged progress?
- What happens when a user converts a target-based goal to a continuous counter goal (or vice versa) after logging progress?
- For continuous counter goals, what happens if a user logs multiple entries on the same day (should it count as 1 day or increment multiple times)?
- For continuous counters, can a user backdate a "reset" event to correct a mistake, and how does this affect the count calculation?
- How does the system handle timezone differences for habit tracking and continuous counters (streak calculation)?
- What happens when a user creates a goal with a deadline that's already passed?
- How are decimal values handled for different unit types (e.g., 0.5 kilometers vs whole numbers for "days without")?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Goal Management
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create goals with a title, unit (text), and goal type (target-based or continuous counter)
- **FR-001a**: For target-based goals, system MUST require a target value (numeric) and deadline (date)
- **FR-001b**: For continuous counter goals (e.g., "days without alcohol"), system MUST NOT require a target or deadline - the goal is to maximize the count over time
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a list of all user goals showing appropriate progress indicator per goal type (percentage for target-based, total count for continuous)
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to edit goal details (title, target, unit, deadline, goal type) after creation

- **FR-005**: System MUST mark target-based goals as "Completed" when progress reaches or exceeds 100% of target
- **FR-005a**: System MUST allow users to manually mark continuous counter goals as "Completed" or "Reset" to start counting again from zero
- **FR-006**: System MUST support multiple unit types (currency, distance, time, count, days, custom text)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can create a new goal and log their first progress entry in under 2 minutes
- **SC-002**: Users can view an accurate visual representation of their progress within 1 second of opening a goal
- **SC-003**: System correctly calculates progress percentages, remaining amounts, and streak counts with 100% accuracy
- **SC-004**: Users can track at least 50 active goals simultaneously without performance degradation
- **SC-005**: 90% of users successfully complete creating their first goal on first attempt without help documentation
- **SC-006**: Charts and visualizations are readable and understandable on both desktop (1920x1080) and mobile (375x667) screen sizes
- **SC-007**: Habit streak calculations remain accurate across timezone changes and daylight saving time transitions for all supported frequency patterns (daily, weekly, custom intervals, monthly, complex)
- **SC-008**: System maintains 99.9% uptime for goal and progress data availability
- **SC-009**: Users can access their complete progress history dating back to account creation
- **SC-010**: Complex habit frequency patterns (e.g., "3 times per week on weekdays only") calculate streaks and completion status correctly 100% of the time

### Qualitative Outcomes

- Users report feeling motivated by visual progress indicators
- Users find the unified model intuitive for different goal types (financial, health, lifestyle)
- Users appreciate the simplicity of the interface over feature complexity
- Users successfully transition between goal tracking and habit tracking without confusion

## Assumptions

- Users have internet connectivity for web application access (offline support not required for V1)
- Progress logging will be primarily manual; automated logging (if implemented) will be via manual integrations or third-party APIs in future versions
- Analytics will focus on personal progress trends, not social features or comparisons with other users
- Initial version targets individual users; team/shared goals are out of scope
- Users are comfortable with basic data visualization concepts (line charts, percentages)
- Date/time handling will use user's local timezone
- Currency conversion is out of scope; users enter values in their preferred currency
- For continuous counter goals (e.g., "days without alcohol"), the count represents consecutive successful days - any reset event starts the count from 0
- Continuous counters typically track daily progress, but the system will support any unit (days, hours, weeks, etc.)
- Users understand the difference between target-based goals (finite with deadline) and continuous counters (ongoing without deadline)
- Incremental progress logging is the natural mental model for most users ("I added X today" vs "I have Y total")
- Complex habit frequency patterns will require clear UI/UX to avoid confusion, but power users will benefit from flexibility
- Habit streak calculation for complex patterns (e.g., "3x/week on weekdays") follows consistent logic: target met within period = streak continues

## Out of Scope (Explicitly Excluded from V1)

- **Reminders and notifications** (in-app, email, push, or SMS) - Feature postponed to V2+ after core tracking proves valuable
- Social features (sharing goals, competing with friends)
- Automated data import from fitness trackers, bank accounts, or other services
- AI-powered suggestions or goal recommendations
- Gamification elements beyond streaks (badges, points, levels)
- Export to external calendar systems
- Integration with third-party apps
- Voice input for progress logging
- Collaborative/shared goals between multiple users
- Complex analytics and predictive modeling
- Native mobile applications (web application must be mobile-responsive, but native iOS/Android apps are future phases)

**Status**: âœ… Specification complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`

## Decision Log

**User Decisions Made (2025-10-25)**:

1. **Reminders (Q1)**: Out of scope for V1 - Feature postponed to V2+ after core tracking functionality proves valuable
2. **Progress Entry Mode (Q2)**: Incremental only - Users log amounts added (e.g., "I saved $100 today"), system calculates cumulative total
3. **Habit Frequency Patterns (Q3)**: Full flexibility - Support daily, weekly, custom intervals, monthly, and complex patterns (e.g., "3x/week on weekdays")

**Constitution Compliance Note**: Decision Q3 (full flexibility for habits) adds significant complexity. During planning phase, implementation should be carefully architected to maintain code simplicity despite feature complexity. Consider phased rollout: basic patterns first (daily/weekly), then advanced patterns in subsequent iterations within V1.
