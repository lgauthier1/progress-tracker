## üîç Summary: MVP Phase 1-3 Alignment

### ‚úÖ Implemented (Core MVP)
- **Goal CRUD**: Create, read, delete ‚úÖ
- **Goal types**: Target-based + Continuous counter ‚úÖ
- **Progress CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete ‚úÖ
- **Date picker**: Custom dates for progress entries ‚úÖ
- **Progress calculation**: Incremental + auto-recalc ‚úÖ
- **Authentication**: Register, login, logout ‚úÖ
- **Authorization**: User data isolation ‚úÖ
- **Progress display**: %, count, days remaining/elapsed ‚úÖ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented
- **FR-003 (Edit goal)**: Backend ready, UI missing
- **FR-009a (Reset continuous)**: Can use negative values (workaround)

### ‚ùå Missing from MVP Scope (Expected)
- **FR-005**: Auto-complete target-based goals at 100%
- **FR-005a**: Manual complete/reset UI for continuous goals
- **All FR-015 to FR-018**: Charts (Phase 4 scope)
- **All FR-019 to FR-024**: Habits (Phase 5 scope)
- **All FR-025 to FR-028**: Categories (Phase 6 scope)

## üö® Critical Gaps for MVP

### Priority 1 - Should fix before Phase 4
1. **FR-005**: Auto-complete target-based goals when currentValue >= targetValue
   - **Impact**: Goals stay ACTIVE even when completed
   - **Fix**: Add logic in `progress-entries.service.ts` after recalculation
   - **Effort**: 10 min

2. **FR-003**: Add Edit Goal UI
   - **Impact**: Can't fix mistakes in goal settings
   - **Fix**: Add edit modal in GoalDetail (similar to edit progress)
   - **Effort**: 15 min

### Priority 2 - Nice to have (can defer)
3. **FR-005a**: Manual complete/reset for continuous counters
   - **Impact**: Workaround exists (negative progress)
   - **Fix**: Add "Complete" and "Reset" buttons
   - **Effort**: 10 min

---

## üìä Recommendation

### Option A: Fix critical gaps now (25 min)
‚úÖ Fix FR-005 (auto-complete)  
‚úÖ Fix FR-003 (edit goal UI)  
‚úÖ Then run tests  
‚úÖ Then Phase 4  

### Option B: Run tests first, fix if blocking (15 min)
‚úÖ Run contract tests  
‚úÖ Fix only if tests fail  
‚è≠Ô∏è Defer FR-003/FR-005 to post-Phase 4  
‚úÖ Phase 4 immediately  

### Option C: Skip to Phase 4 (0 min)
‚è≠Ô∏è Defer all fixes  
‚úÖ Phase 4 Charts  
‚ùì Risk: Incomplete behavior might confuse chart implementation  

**My recommendation**: **Option A**  
- FR-005 is critical (completed goals should show as completed)
- FR-003 is important UX (users will want to edit goals)
- 25 min investment now = cleaner Phase 4
- Tests will validate the fixes

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

Based on your choice:
1. **If Option A**: Implement FR-005 + FR-003, then tests, then Phase 4
2. **If Option B**: Run tests now, fix critical failures, then Phase 4
3. **If Option C**: Phase 4 immediately

**What do you choose?** A, B, or C?
